* Redesign
** DONE Currently traverse is designed to not change traversable object. This is strong assumption, and should be removed.
   CLOSED: [2018-03-04 nie 18:24]
** DONE Aggregate functions should not change range (because it makes things complicated).
   CLOSED: [2018-02-12 pon 10:30]
*** DONE Add clone-and-traverse (like traverse, but will never alter passed range).

* TODO Add function for changing final result of aggregation.
* DONE Add batches function (divides range into partitions of fixed size for aggregation)
  CLOSED: [2020-01-14 wto 10:31]
* DONE Add some sort of data frame.
  CLOSED: [2020-01-14 wto 10:31]
* closure compilation
** TODO Rewrite all multistage aggregations into single stage aggregations so the whole concept can be scrapped
*** started today, finished with math <2020-01-14 wto>
*** finished with clara <2020-01-15 śro>
** TODO Add additional argument: element-type to the aggregation functions.
** TODO remove aggregator protocol, design the new protocol based around closures.

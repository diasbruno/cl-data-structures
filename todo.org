* Redesign 
** TODO Currently traverse is designed to not change traversable object. This is strong assumption, and should be removed.
** TODO Aggregate functions should not change range (because it makes things complicated).
*** TODO Add clone-and-traverse (like traverse, but will never alter passed range).

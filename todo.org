** TODO Currently traverse is designed to not change traversable object. This is strong assumption, and should be removed.
** DONE Aggregate functions should not change range (because it makes things complicated).

*** DONE Add clone-and-traverse (like traverse, but will never alter passed range).
    CLOSED: [2018-02-12 pon 10:30]
